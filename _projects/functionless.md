As an ultimate design condition, we focus on technique elaboration, material intelligence, formal logic efficiencies, and precision assemblies. We develop and investigate the notion of proficient geometric variations at a level of complexity so that questions about geometrical effectiveness, accuracy, and performance can begin to be understood in a contemporary setting. We explore a discourse using multi-layered techniques and production processes that allow for control over intelligent geometries, calibration of parts, and behavioral taxonomies, normalizing an innovative held of predictability.
